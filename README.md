# Rust Learning Journeu

Rust learning journey repo! This repo serves as a personal cheatsheet which documents things learned about Rust so far. It might help new engineers @(Grof) quickly get up to speed with key concepts in Rust, including how to work with the language, understand common compile-time errors, e.t.c.

## Goals and Learning Focus

This repository is fordocumenting concepts learnt and the ones being actively explored, including:
- Using `cargo` for project management
- Understanding and reading compile-time errors
- Exploring different data types
- Learning syntax and best practices
- Understanding functions, control flow...

## Learning Progress

Below is a checklist of topics covered so far, and it will be updated.

### ✅ Concept Learnt

- [x] **Using Cargo**: How to create, build, run, and test a Rust project with Cargo.
- [x] **Reading Compile-time Errors**: How to understand and resolve common compile-time errors in Rust.
- [x] **Data Types**: Understanding Rust’s primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, characters, strings).
- [x] **Syntax**: Basic syntax and structure of Rust programs (declarations, statements, expressions).
- [x] **Functions**: Defining and using functions, understanding function signatures, and return types.
- [x] **Control Flow**: Understanding `if`, `else`, `match`, loops (`for`, `while`, `loop`).
- [ ] **Ownership and Borrowing**: Understanding the concepts of ownership, borrowing, and references in Rust.
- [ ] **Structs and Enums**: How to define and work with structs and enums.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Handling errors using `Result` and `Option` types.
- [ ] **Concurrency**: Exploring Rust's approach to concurrency and parallelism.
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Learning about Rust's memory model (stack vs heap, memory safety).
- [ ] **Testing**: Writing unit tests and using Rust's testing framework.

## Sections

### 1. **Cargo**

`cargo` is Rust’s build system and package manager. I’ll explain how to:
- Initialize a project (`cargo new`)
- Build and run the project (`cargo build`, `cargo run`)
- Add dependencies via `Cargo.toml`
- Run tests (`cargo test`)

### 2. **Reading Compile-time Errors**

Compile-time errors are an important part of Rust’s safety checks. I’ll document:
- Common error types and messages I’ve encountered
- How to interpret and resolve these errors
- Rust’s approach to error messages and why they are so helpful

### 3. **Data Types**

Understanding Rust’s primitive data types is key to writing efficient and correct programs. I’ll cover:
- Integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, characters, and strings
- Working with constants and mutable variables

### 4. **Syntax**

Rust’s syntax can be tricky at first, but once understood, it becomes very intuitive. I’ll cover:
- Variable declarations, expressions, and statements
- The basic structure of Rust programs
- Scope, ownership, and mutability

### 5. **Functions**

Functions are fundamental in Rust. I’ll explain:
- How to define functions, pass arguments, and return values
- Function signatures and type inference
- Closures and higher-order functions

### 6. **Control Flow**

Control flow is essential for decision-making and iteration. I’ll cover:
- Using `if`, `else`, and `match` statements
- Looping with `for`, `while`, and `loop`

## Future Additions

- **Ownership and Borrowing**: I'll be learning about how Rust’s ownership system prevents memory safety issues and enforces borrow checking.
- **Structs and Enums**: How to use these to define custom data types.
- **Error Handling**: Using Rust’s `Result` and `Option` to handle recoverable and unrecoverable errors.
- **Concurrency**: Leveraging Rust’s approach to concurrent programming.
- **Memory Management**: Understanding how memory is managed with Rust’s ownership and borrowing system.
